        <p><img src="assets/quote-bg.png" alt="">Poverty is a threat to peace. World’s income distribution gives a very telling story. 
            Ninety-four percent of the world income goes to 40 percent of the world population, while 60
            percent of people live only with 6 percent of the world income. Half of the world population 
            lives on $2 a day. The millennium began with a great global dream. World leaders gathered at 
            the United Nations in 2000 and adopted, among others, a historic goal to reduce poverty by 
            half by 2015. Never in human history had such a bold goal been adopted by the entire world in 
            one voice, one that specified time and size.</p><br>
